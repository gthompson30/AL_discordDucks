QCC:
 - Is there a built-in Java class that functions the same as OrderedSuperArray?
 - How efficient are SuperArray's in comparison to regular arrays? How does the memory
   allocation work on the low level, with deleting and adding elements? 
 - In what contexts would you need an OrderedSuperArray?
 - We're still sort of confused -- how exactly is OrderedSuperArray a wrapper class,
   in the same way that Integer is? It seems like something that you instantiate,
   rather than call functions from, alone

DISCO:
 - Binary search is tedious to implement because of off-by-one errors
 - OrderedArrayList is meant to be something that you *instantiate*, rather than refer to.
 - Binary search can be implemented by shifting an upper and lower bounds, rather than
   by literally splitting the array into two.
