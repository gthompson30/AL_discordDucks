- **ALTester
- Populates an ArrayList with 23 Integers and determine whether the list is sorted or not. We are creating an array list using our wrapper class OrderedArrayList and then checking if the items in the array are in order. This functionality enables java to not just place a value at the end or start of an array, but be able to put the value in the right place in the array so that the array is increasing in order from 1 to 23 in increasing order. 
- **OrderedArrayList
- The add method in our OrderedArrayList class functions as it iterates through each index and checks the value for each index. It then puts the number in the correct position where the array is in correct ascending order.
